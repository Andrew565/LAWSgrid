# Layout ala World of Solitaire

_A Theory_

* Grid-like layout, with rows and columns
* Each position is a slot where things can be placed, like a deck, a foundation, or a stack of cards
* Each slot can have modifiers to specify position changes, like 'normal', 'horizontal-right', 'left-45', 'slide-left-50', etc.
* Decisions about what actually goes in each slot should be specified by the game engine
